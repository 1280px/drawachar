My school graduation project I decided to finish and publish the code. Originally inspired by Windows IME Pad, the idea of the extension is to self-train the net with hand-drawn samples and then use it for quick access to added symbols or phrases.

This was rather an experiment, as I was working with TFJS for the first time. There were also a few previous attempts based on [brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) and [HanziLookupJS](https://github.com/gugray/HanziLookupJS), but Tensorflow.JS+MN+KNN gives the best recognition quality.
